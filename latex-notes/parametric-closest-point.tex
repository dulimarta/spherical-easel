\section*{Closest Point To Parametric Curve}
Given a parametric curve $P(t)$ a point $Q$ outside the curve, sample points $L$, $M$, and $R$ where their associated time value are in
in the following order $t_L < t_M < t_R$). Point $M$ is the closest sample point to $Q$.

\begin{tikzpicture}
  \draw[domain=0:6,blue,smooth, thick] plot ({\x}, {8*\x/3 - \x^2 + \x^3/12});
  \coordinate (L) at (2,2);
  \coordinate (M) at (3,1.25);
  \coordinate (R) at (4,0);
  \coordinate (Q) at (3.1, 0.5);
  \draw [fill] (L) circle(2pt);
  \draw [fill] (M) circle(2pt);
  \draw [fill] (R) circle(2pt);
  \draw [fill, red] (Q) circle(2pt);
  \node [above] at (M) {M};
  \node [right] at (L) {L};
  \node [right] at (R) {R};
  \node [left,red] at (Q) {Q};
\end{tikzpicture}

the \textbf{true} closest point on $P(t)$ from $Q$ is computed using the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Find the closest sample point on $P(t)$ from $Q$ (which is point $M$ in the illustration)
  \item Determine the left neighbor ($L$) and right neighbor ($R$) of $M$ (if they exist).
  Here, ``left''/``right'' is implied by their $t$ ordering (not by the coordinates)
  \item Form the following 3D vectors: $\vec{MQ}$, $\vec{MR}$, and $\vec{ML}$.
  \item If $\alpha = \angle (MQ, MR)$ is acute (determined by positive dot product),
  then the true closest point is somewhere between $M$ and $R$
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Use dot product to determine $MQ'$ the projection of $MQ$ along $MR$
    \item Calculate $f$ the ratio of lengths between $MQ'$ and $MR$,
    $$f = \frac{|MQ'|}{|MR|}= \frac{|MQ| \cos\alpha}{|MR|} = \frac{|MQ||MR| \cos\alpha}{|MR|^2} = \frac{\vec{MQ}\cdot \vec{MR}}{|MR|^2}$$
    \item Calculate the time value associated with point $Q'$ using linear interpolation
    $t_{Q'} = (1-f)t_M + ft_R$
    \item The true closest point on the curve from $Q$ is $P(t_{Q'})$
    \item Stop
  \end{itemize}
  \item If $\beta = \angle (MQ, ML)$ is acute (determined by positive dot product),
  then the true closest point is somewhere between $L$ and $M$
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Repeat similar steps above
  \end{itemize}

\end{enumerate}
